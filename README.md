# Bits

Bits is small standalone Windows utility that checks if a PE file (for example an .exe or .dll)
is 32 or 64-bit from an Explorer right-click menu.

## Installation
  Bits is composed of a single file (Bits.exe). Unzip the downloaded zip file and place "Bits.exe" in it wherever you like. To install/uninstall the Explorer context menu simply run the program and follow the prompts.

## Usage
  Right click on the file and choose “32 or 64-bit” from the context menu.
