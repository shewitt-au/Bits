# Bits

Bits is small standalone Windows utility that checks if a PE
file (for example an .exe or .dll) is 32 or 64-bit from an
Explorer right-click menu.

## Installation
Bits is composed of a single file (Bits.exe). Unzip the
downloaded zip file and place the "Bits.exe" file within it
wherever you like. To install/uninstall the Explorer context
menu simply run the program and follow the prompts.

## Usage
Right click on the file and choose “32 or 64-bit” from the
context menu.

## Design philosophy
Bits is designed to be as small as possible, to have as few
dependencies as possible and consist of a single file. It would
be nice if it’s useful too. Another goal is for the code to be
a guide on how to create apps in C/C++ with these constraints.
